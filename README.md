# Machine Learning Projects Repository

## Overview
Welcome to my **Machine Learning Projects** repository! This repository contains various machine learning projects I have worked on with my friend Arhat Jain, covering different domains and techniques. Each project is well-documented with code, datasets, and explanations.

## Contents
This repository includes:
- **Supervised Learning**: Projects involving classification and regression using algorithms like SVM, Random Forest, and Neural Networks.
- **Unsupervised Learning**: Clustering and dimensionality reduction techniques such as K-Means, PCA, and Autoencoders.
- **Deep Learning**: Implementations of neural networks, CNNs, RNNs, and transformers.
- **Reinforcement Learning**: Experimentation with Q-learning and deep reinforcement learning methods.
- **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**: Text classification, sentiment analysis, and chatbot implementations.
- **Computer Vision**: Image classification, object detection, and segmentation projects.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: Primary language for development.

## How to Use
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/machine-learning-projects.git
   ```
2. Navigate to a specific project folder.
3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. Run the notebook or script as instructed in the README of each project.
5. Some development is still remaining for proper installations 

## Future Plans
- Implement more real-world case studies.
- Experiment with cutting-edge AI techniques and new models.
- Optimize existing models for better performance.
